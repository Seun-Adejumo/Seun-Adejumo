I am a Biostatistician/Data Scientist with interests in high dimensional data, and longitudinal models. The idea is to apply these methods to improve population health outcomes. 
I have associate degree in Statistics, BSc in Demography and Statistics, and MS in Biostatistics & Epidemiology. PhD?...Emm., thinking about it! 

A little more details for you below:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning study simulations and method developments
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything related to predictive modelling, machine learning, and more generally data science
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: excel.asa@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I sing when I'm tired of coding. ~~I may consider music as my side hustle you know.~~ ðŸ˜‰

*Feel free to reach out for collaboration and support.*
